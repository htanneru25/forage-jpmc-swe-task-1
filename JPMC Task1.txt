Client
The first script is focused on creating a simulated stock market environment and generating random market conditions and orders. It consists of several components:

1. **Simulation Parameters:** It defines parameters such as simulation length, market open time, and parameters related to market conditions and trades.

2. **Test Data Generation:** It generates random market conditions and limit orders based on the defined parameters.

3. **Order Book Operations:** It includes functions to manage the order book, such as adding orders, clearing crossed orders, and generating order books from orders.

4. **Test Data Persistence:** It provides functionality to generate test data and read it from a CSV file.

5. **Server:** It sets up an HTTP server using Python's built-in `http.server` module to serve the simulated market data.

6. **App:** It represents the trading game server application, which initializes order books and handles HTTP requests for querying stock data.

Server
The second script is the HTTP server itself, which utilizes the functionalities provided by the first script. 

It sets up a multithreaded HTTP server using Python's `http.server` module, defines routes for handling different types of requests, and implements methods to handle those requests. 

The server responds to queries by providing the current top of the order book for two different stocks ("ABC" and "DEF"). 

It continuously serves requests while the program is running and uses the simulated market data generated by the first script to respond to queries about stock prices and sizes.

In summary, the first script simulates a stock market environment, while the second script serves as an HTTP server to interact with the simulated market data. Together, they create a basic simulation of a stock market with the ability to query stock data over HTTP.
